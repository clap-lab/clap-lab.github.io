title: Human-Centered Data Science 
description: Research Group at the University of Göttingen
---
We are a research group led by [Prof. Lisa Beinborn](https://beinborn.eu/) at the institute of computer science (University of Göttingen). 

If you are interested in our work, reach out to claplab[at]cs.uni-goettingen.de.

**Research**

We work on natural language processing (NLP) with a human-centered perspective. We want to develop poly-vocal models that account for human variation, uncertainty, and cognitive complexity and are currently most interested in the following topics: 

- Multilingual NLP
- (Cognitively Plausible) Representation Learning
- Interpretability and Bias of Machine Learning Models
- Educational Language Technology
- Modelling Eye-Tracking Data of Language Processing

If you want to be informed about upcoming talks and events, subscribe to our [mailing list](https://listserv.gwdg.de/mailman/listinfo/nlp)

**Teaching**

We will offer the following lectures and seminars: 
- Language as Data
- Advanced NLP
- Interpretability and Bias in Machine Learning
- Data Science with Cognitive Signals
