This page is under construction. The research group is currently initiated by [Prof. Lisa Beinborn](https://beinborn.eu/) at the institute of computer science. We work on natural language processing research and are interested in the following topics:

- Cognitively plausible representation learning
- Interpretability and bias of language models
- Cross-lingual transfer in multilingual models
- Educational language technology
- Poly-vocal models that account for human variation, uncertainty and cognitive complexity
- Cross-lingual patterns in eye tracking data of reading

We will offer the following lectures and seminars: 
- Language as Data
- Advanced NLP
- Interpretability and Bias in Machine Learning
- Data Science with Cognitive Signals

Associated researchers: 
- Victor Zimmermann
- Jenia Kim
- Jonathan Kamp
- Miyu Oba

We initiated the [HumanCLAIM](https://clap-lab.github.io/workshop) workshop series.
