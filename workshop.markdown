title: HumanCLAIM Workshop
description: The Human Perspective on Cross-Lingual AI Models
---
The 2023 edition can be found [here](/workshop2023.markdown).

## Motivation

Linguistic diversity is one of the fundamental rights of the European Union and we are optimistic that cross-lingual AI models can play an important role in facilitating it. Cross-lingual models based on neural networks are trained on terabytes of data and have recently reached large performance gains. As the computationally expensive training of such models can only be afforded by large companies, the evaluation of cross-lingual models is driven by commercial incentives and focuses on the average quantitative performance across more than a hundred languages. The intricacies of application scenarios for low-resource languages or economically insignificant purposes are largely being overlooked and individual differences between users are underestimated. When we want to use cross-lingual models for human-centered scenarios such as cognitive modeling, language education, or for use cases in the digital humanities, we quickly encounter their limitations. 

In this workshop, we want to bring together leading scholars from linguistics, cognitive science, and computer science to develop a more diverse and human-centered perspective on cross-lingual models.  We want to integrate typological theories about differences between language families, cognitive models of multilingual processing, and computational approaches towards increasing diversity in language technology.

Participation in the workshop is free of charge but the number of participants is limited. 
Registration is open.
